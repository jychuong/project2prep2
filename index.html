      Example 1
    </h2>
    <p>
      Besides clicking around objects trying to find the bird, I want the user to be able to small intereactions with other things in the rooms. 
      <br>
      Like in this case, being able to bounce a ball on the floor. 
      <br> 
      I modified <a href = "https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-spring.html">this example</a> by playing around with the shapes, colors, and manipulating the spring values.  
    </p>
      <div id="sketch1">

    <h2>
      Example 2
    </h2>
    <p>
      For all of the objects that can interact, I want them to play a quick short sound effect whenever I mouse over them. 
      I used <a href ="https://p5js.org/examples/sound-sound-effect.html">this example</a>. 
      <br> I changed the color, slightly changed the shape, and made the sound play by mouse over instead of clicking.
